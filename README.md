Data analytics Python project to apply multiple
machine learning models in three different datasets to
analyze each model’s performance and how they work in
different types of datasets. The first dataset is a numerical-heavy dataset that contains several factors on students performance, such as attendance, study hours, and socio-
economic background; used in determining or predicting the performance of the students. The second one deals with a critical issue: mental health, or more precisely,
it detects depression using different machine learning
models including Naive Bayes, Regression, and some other
text preprocessing techniques. 
The third dataset contains text-heavy data of Human text and AI generated text and the ML techniques such as NLP, naive Bayes detects the generator of those texts with human benchmarks on their accuracy, efficiency, and
reliability in performing specific tasks. Each dataset
undergoes preprocessing and model development, and the
evaluation metrics include accuracy, r2, RMSE, confusion
matrices, and error analysis. In total, I have applied 7
different models among all datasets. The results show how
those machine learning models are effective in education,
mental health detection, and AI vs Human text detection,
thus showing their practicality in solving real-world problems.
